# AzizInTheJungle
This is a school project by group of 3 where we had to write an aquarium simulation (2D) of small "bestioles" in C++

These have interesting properties such as personalities (Kamikaze, fearfull, "gregaire"...)
They also can have accessories such as an armor, a speed boost or a invisibility cape (that hides them partially or fully from others)
They can as well have ears and eyes to detect other bestioles

# Requirements
Needs x11(on ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt install libx11-dev
```
